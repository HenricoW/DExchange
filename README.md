# DExchange

An order book based ERC20 decentralised exchange, currently deployed on Rinkeby.

Usage:
- Switch your wallet over to the Rinkeby network
- Go the dApp and connect (https://obdex.netlify.app)
- Switch tokens (near top left) from DAI (the base token) to view order books and charts
- DAI is the base token, so it cannot be traded - other tokens trade against it
- Works with Compound compatible DAI, USDC, ZRX, etc. on Rinkeby
